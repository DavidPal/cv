\section*{Employment}

\begin{longtable}{@{}lp{13cm}}
Sep 2014 -- present & \textbf{Sr. Research Scientist at Yahoo/Oath Research, New York, NY} \\
& {\smallfont I am the lead of the anti-spam and anti-phishing research team for Yahoo Mail. I
build machine learning models that filter spam and phish emails. The work is
done in Java, Scala, and Python. I also do research in online
algorithms for machine learning and in statistical machine learning. I publish
at top machine learning conferences (NIPS, ICML, COLT). This year, I am an area
research chair for NIPS 2018.} \\
\\
Sep 2011 -- Sep 2014 & \textbf{Software Engineer at Google, New York, NY} \\
& {\smallfont I was a backend engineer on the Google Ad Exchange team. I co-designed,
co-patented and implemented the ``passback'' ad auction, which---to this
day---processes all the 100+ billion AdX impressions per day and generates
revenue of tens of billions of dollars per year. I also worked data pipelines
for reserve price optimization for AdX. The work was done in C++ and
Python.} \\
\\
Jul 2007 -- Sep 2007 & \textbf{Research Internship at Google, New York, NY} \\
& {\smallfont I designed an ad action for AdWords that unifies GSP (generalized
second price) and VCG (Vickrey-Clarke-Groves) auctions. I didn't write a single
line of code; I design algorithms on paper and proved mathematical theorems
about them. The end result was an academic paper and an algorithm that Google
later used.} \\
\\
Jun 2004 -- Dec 2004 & \textbf{Programmer at Applied Software Consultants, Bratislava, Slovakia} \\
& {\smallfont I was a software engineer in a small family-run company that develops
software for elementary schools and high schools. I worked on a desktop
application to keep track of students, their grades, etc. The work was done in C\# and PHP.} \\
\\
Jun 2000 -- Jun 2004 & \textbf{Webmaster of Internet Problem Solving Contest} \\
& {\smallfont I was the webmaster and a co-organizer of the Internet Problem
Solving Contest. This is the first programming contest in the world in which
contestants submit output data instead of source code, which allows them to use
any programming language. The work was done in PHP, Pascal and C.} \\
