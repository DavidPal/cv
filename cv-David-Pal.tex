\section*{Employment}

\begin{longtable}{@{}lp{13cm}}
May 2019 -- present & \textbf{Principal Applied Researcher at Expedia Group, New York, NY} \\
& {\smallfont I am part of the applied research team. I work on marketing and advertising
problems. Currently, I am focusing on how much to bid on web search ads on Google and Bing
and meta-search engines such as TripAdvisor, Trivago, Kayak.
I am reviewer for ICML and area chair for NIPS.
} \\
\\
SSep 2014 -- May 2019 & \textbf{Senior Research Scientist at Yahoo/Oath/Verizon Media Research, New York, NY} \\
& {\smallfont I built machine learning models that filter spam and phish emails. Many of the
models were based on large scale clustering of emails. I designed implemented
the first version of the clustering algorithm. The work was done in Java, Scala,
and Python. The system was patented. I did also theoretical research in online
algorithms for machine learning and in statistical machine learning, published
at NIPS and ICML. I am reviewer for COLT, ICML and area chair for NIPS.} \\
\\
Sep 2011 -- Sep 2014 & \textbf{Software Engineer at Google, New York, NY} \\
& {\smallfont I was a backend engineer on the Google Ad Exchange team. I
co-designed, co-patented and implemented the ``passback'' ad auction algorithm,
which---to this day---processes all the 100+ billion AdX impressions per day and
generates revenue of tens of billions of dollars per year. I also worked on the
data pipelines for reserve price optimization for AdX. The work was done in C++
and Python.} \\
\\
Jul 2007 -- Sep 2007 & \textbf{Research Internship at Google, New York, NY} \\
& {\smallfont I co-designed an ad auction algorithm for AdWords that unifies GSP
(generalized second price) and VCG (Vickrey-Clarke-Groves) auctions and proved
mathematical theorems about it. The end result was an academic paper with description
of the algorithm and its properties that Google later used.} \\
\\
Jun 2004 -- Dec 2004 & \textbf{Programmer at Applied Software Consultants, Bratislava, Slovakia} \\
& {\smallfont I was a software engineer in a small family-run company that
develops software for elementary schools and high schools. I worked on a desktop
application that keeps track of students, their grades, etc. The work was done in
C\# and PHP.} \\
